<h2>PROPOSITION DE STAGE – L3 INFORMATIQUE – ENS LYON</h2>

If you are interested in doing an internship on the topic of quantum algorithms and computing, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:apers@irif.fr">apers@irif.fr</A>.
Below is one suggested topic, but also do not hesitate to ask for others.

<p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Quantum expansion testing. </b>
	<br><br>
	Quantum expanders are a generalization of expander graphs to the quantum setting [BST10]. In the classical setting, there is a famous random walk algorithm for testing whether a graph is an expander or not [GR11]. Goal of the internship is to devise a quantum algorithm for testing quantum expanders.<br><br>
