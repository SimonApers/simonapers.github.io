<h2>PROPOSITION DE STAGE – L3 INFORMATIQUE – ENS LYON</h2>

If you are interested in doing an internship on the topic of quantum algorithms and computing, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:apers@irif.fr">apers@irif.fr</A>.
Below is one suggested topic, but also do not hesitate to ask for others.

<p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Quantum HITS. </b>
	<br><br>
	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HITS_algorithm">HITS algorithm</A> is a web link analysis algorithm proposed by Jon Kleinberg, comparable to Google's PageRank algorithm. It is based on the singular value decomposition of the adjacency matrix of a directed graph. In contrast to Google's PageRank algorithm, there is no known space-efficient implementation of the HITS algorithm. Aim of the project is to develop a space-efficient quantum implementation of the HITS algorithm. Starting point is a recent work (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12473">arXiv:2408.12473</A>) showing a quantum space advantage for solving connectivity on directed graphs.
