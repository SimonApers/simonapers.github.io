<h2>Student internships</h2>

If you are interested in doing an internship on the topic of quantum algorithms and computing, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:apers@irif.fr">apers@irif.fr</A>.
Here are some suggested topics:

<p>
<ul>
  <li> <b> Quantum algorithms for graph spanners and sparsifiers. </b>
	<br><br>
	A graph spanner is a sparse subgraph that approximately preserves shortest-path distances. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07306">recent work</a>, a quantum algorithm for constructing graph spanners was described. This was used to obtain faster quantum algorithms for a wide range of graph problems such as graph sparsification, computing the minimum cut, and solving Laplacian systems. The aim of this project is to find a faster quantum algorithm for constructing a spanner of an *unweighted* graph. This would lead to faster algorithms for all of the aforementioned problems as well.

  <li> <b> Quantum algorithm for tree edit distance. </b>
	<br><br>
	While we know quantum speedups for many problems in optimization, the problem of computing the "edit distance" between two strings has always evaded a quantum speedup. Recent work in quantum fine-grained complexity suggests that in no fact quantum speedup is possible for this problem (<a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2021/13664/pdf/LIPIcs-STACS-2021-19.pdf">link</a>). A closely related and apparently more motivated problem is that of "tree edit distance", where the goal is to compute the edit distance between two tree graphs instead of two strings. This problem is closely related to computing the max-plus product, for which we do know a quantum speedup. The aim of this project is to study quantum algorithms for tree edit distance, potentially by building on dynamic programming techniques (<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0218082">link</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02026">link</a>).
	<br>
  </li><br>

  <li> <b> OR-query complexity of graph matching. </b>
	<br><br>
	Query complexity studies the number of "queries" or "probes" that one has to make to an object to learn something about it. In a recent work (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02526">arXiv:2208.02526</a>), it was shown that the OR-query complexity of <em>bipartite</em> matching is almost-linear. They used this to bound the <em>quantum</em> query complexity of bipartite matching. In this project we aim to bound the OR-query complexity of <em>general</em> matching by working the other way around. There is a quantum query algorithm for general matching (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02324">arXiv:2010.02324</a>), and we will try to use this to bound the OR-query complexity of general matching.

  <li> <b> Finding many elements with quantum walk search. </b> (co-supervised with A. Chailloux)
	<br><br>
	Quantum walk search was most famously used by Ambainis in his quantum algorithm for element distinctness (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0311001">link</a>), which amounts to finding a collision of a given input function (i.e., x and y such that f(x)=f(y)). This algorithm is the key building block of a broad range of other quantum algorithms in cryptography, property testing, etc. At its core is a quantum walk algorithm for finding a marked element on the Johnson graph quadratically faster. Such a marked element corresponds to a collision in the input function. A recent work by Chailloux and Loyer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05608">arXiv:2105.05608</a>) on quantum algorithms for the shortest vector problem raised the interesting question of whether *multiple* collisions can be found more efficiently then just repeatedly running Ambainis' algorithm. The goal of this project is to investigate this question, which more abstractly amounts to investigating the use of quantum walk search for finding many marked elements.
